# representation-of-ground-tracks-of-artificial-satellites

This project is part of the subject Numerical Calculus in which we have applied different numerical methods to do the calculus in order to represent the ground trakcs of artificial satellites. Later, we have monitored it through the software gnuplot. All the project is detailed in the report which is in Catalan because it is the language used in this subject and it can be executed using the makefile. The project is rated with a ten out of ten.
